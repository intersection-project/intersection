**I just got pinged by Intersection, what does this mean?**

This is probably the most common question we see. Hopefully this will clear things up! Otherwise, I'll link to resources if you'd like to learn more about Intersection.

If you got pinged by Intersection, the bot doesn't want anything from you. Actually, it's the complete opposite - when Intersection pings you, someone else was _using_ the bot to send you a notification. The message you got mentioned in should be a reply to another message (one that likely contains `@{{ ... }}`). Just imagine it as if you had been pinged in that message - this is one of Intersections's main (but most confusing) features. Intersection is an extension to Discord @-mentions, allowing more powerful mentions to be made in advanced situations. Discord doesn't provide a facility for this directly, so Intersection just pings the people it needs to as a reply.

tl;dr: Check the message Intersection was replying to when you got pinged. That's who pinged you. Complain to them, not to us.
