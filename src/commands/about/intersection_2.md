This might seem very complicated at first, and that's because it is! Even for people with serious experience in Discord, Intersection will have a large learning curve! It might be helpful if you have existing experience with set theory, boolean logic, and the overall syntax of DRQL.

Because of the large learning curve, we provide a variety of resources for your convenience, to help you learn how to use Intersection:

-   A basic explanation of set theory and how Intersection takes advantage of it: {cmd_about_set_theory}
-   An explanation of how to use DRQL: {cmd_about_drql}

We're working on a guided tutorial for you! Keep an eye out here for when it is available.

**Are you interested in the internals? Maybe you want to contribute to Intersection?** Take a look at {cmd_about_how_it_works}! We'd love your help.
