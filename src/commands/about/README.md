# the `/about` command

The `/about` command contains a bunch of tutorials and information about how Intersection works.

However, a lot of this text is REALLY long, so some text files exist here to contain that text.
They're markdown files for syntax highlighting, but it's Discord flavored markdown, and they MAY
be within a `format!` expansion!

They're probably used as `format!(include_str!(file), ...)`
